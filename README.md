This is just a simple and very dirty script I put together to be able to upload applications build with Arduino IDE and the RedbearLab library for the nrf51822.

It was made by using the Adafruit example and nrf51_dfu_tool from xiongyihui

You need to install "Adafruit_Python_BluefruitLE" first.

This script is for OSX only.

Still a lot to do on this script, but it does the job.
